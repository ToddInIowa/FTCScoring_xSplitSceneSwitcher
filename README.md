# FTCScoring_xSplitSceneSwitcher
This Xsplit Broadcaster plugin allows for automatic scene switching based on the field being played by connecting to the scoring system API via websocket.

You must have more scenes configured than you have fields.

The plugin page must be kept open to keep the websocket open.

By default the plugin assigns Field 1 to Scene 1, Field 2 to Scene 2, and on.
